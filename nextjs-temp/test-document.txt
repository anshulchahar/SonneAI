Test Plain Text Document

This is a test plain text document used to verify that the Sonne application can properly process .txt files.

The Sonne application should be able to:
- Extract the content from this text file
- Process it through the Gemini API
- Generate a meaningful analysis

Plain text files are one of the simplest document formats, but they're still widely used for notes, documentation, and other purposes where formatting isn't necessary.

This document should be analyzed by the application and produce results similar to those for PDF, Markdown, and DOCX files.

If you can see an analysis of this document in the interface, then text file processing is working correctly.
